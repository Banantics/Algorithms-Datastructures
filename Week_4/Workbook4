## Provided code

The `zip` file on Blackboard contains the C code for this week.
The project contains three *targets*: `stacks`, `queues` and `circular-buffer`.

Also, the project uses a static library that provides an array and a linked list.
If you're on Windows, then run your code on WSL.

## Activities

Make sure to have the activities signed off regularly to ensure progress is tracked.

### Activity 1: LIFO vs FIFO

The acronym for LIFO are Last In First Out
The ancronym for FIFO is First In First Out
Its memory buffer because if you input a element it keeps the fist imputed element and removes the last inputed element first
